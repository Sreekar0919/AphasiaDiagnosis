# AphasiaDiagnosis

Hi! This is my work in aphasia diagnosis using Large Language Models!

It requires an AWS accound and access to AWS Bedrock. 

There are certain files that were used to guide treatment for patients but these are optional and you would be able to run by deleting these files or substituting with your own therapy manuals
